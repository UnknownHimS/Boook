      <h2>Chapter 1 ⮟</h2>
      <p>
        It began when I was in senior high school. I rarely talked to anyone and was always the quietest boy in class.
        I grew up with an online girl best friend. Back in high school, I always had my headphones on. I used to play a lot of computer games, and somehow, I got interested in coding. I started building websites and even published a few online — but just like me, they were invisible.
        
        At school, one morning, I was shocked to see new faces in our classroom. The teacher said,
        “Shiro, sit down. Don’t mind them, class — he’s just like that.”
        They began introducing themselves, and so did we. After that, nothing much happened. I looked out the window and thought, It must be nice to have some friends.
        I didn’t even realize I said it out loud — thankfully, it wasn’t too loud.
        
        Then someone responded, in a gentle voice, “Let’s be friends.”
        
        I was shocked and froze — especially because it was a girl.
        “I’m Lex,” she said.
        
        I just looked at her, stood up, and walked straight to the bathroom.
        The teacher said, “This is the first time I’ve seen him like that, anyway.”

        I rushed to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. I washed my face and whispered, “Finally… I’ve got someone in person.”
I wanted to apologize, but I was too shy to even speak.

So, I headed back to class and listened to the lecture. The girl just looked at me.
That night, I had my laptop on in my room. I stared at the sky through the window beside me and said,
“That’s it. I’ll build her a website — as an apology and a way to make friends.”
So I worked on it all night.

My phone started buzzing.
My grandma shouted, “Get up now or you’ll be late!”
It was only five minutes before class started. I rushed out to school, and when I got there, I saw a guy — kind of feminine — touching the girl who had spoken to me the day before.
I don’t know why, but I suddenly felt like throwing my laptop at him. Or my bag.

Wait — my bag!
Oh no, I forgot it!

The teacher looked at me and said,
“Where have you been? Did you lock yourself in the bathroom again?”
She thought I had just come back from there.

I sat near the window again.
She whispered to me, “After school, I can lend you my notes.”
I looked at her and said, “Sure. I want to show you something too.”

After school, we went to the playground nearby and started talking.
At first, I was nervous to show her the website. I wanted to just say sorry, but instead, I showed it to her.
She was surprised.

“Wow, that’s cool! But it’s okay, I know you’re just shy. Haha. Let’s be friends!”

I smiled. “Let’s be friends.”

She handed me her notes, and since the playground was next to a church, we went there. We laughed, prayed, and listened quietly.

Before going home, we sat and rested for a while. We were getting closer...
But suddenly, someone called her. She started crying and hurried off.
She didn’t even say goodbye.
I didn’t chase her or ask what happened — she looked like she was in a rush.

The next morning, in class, she wasn’t there.
I asked the teacher where she was and what was wrong.
The teacher said, “I can’t share private information.”

So I started investigating on my own.

I went to the library and started reading — there was a detective novel that gave me some ideas. I ended up spending the whole day in the library instead of attending class.
After that, I bought everything I thought I’d need, and even though I’m an introvert, I began questioning people who might know something.

Finally, her cousin told me:
“It’s her dad. Someone stabbed him. He’s in the hospital now.”

I asked for the hospital details and rushed there.

When I saw her, I hugged her and said,
“You made me worry…”
