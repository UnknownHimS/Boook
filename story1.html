      <h2>Chapter 1 ⮟</h2>
      <p>
        It began when I was in senior high school. I rarely talked to anyone and was always the quietest boy in class.
        I grew up with an online girl best friend. Back in high school, I always had my headphones on. I used to play a lot of computer games, and somehow, I got interested in coding. I started building websites and even published a few online — but just like me, they were invisible.
        
        At school, one morning, I was shocked to see new faces in our classroom. The teacher said,
        “Shiro, sit down. Don’t mind them, class — he’s just like that.”
        They began introducing themselves, and so did we. After that, nothing much happened. I looked out the window and thought, It must be nice to have some friends.
        I didn’t even realize I said it out loud — thankfully, it wasn’t too loud.
        
        Then someone responded, in a gentle voice, “Let’s be friends.”
        
        I was shocked and froze — especially because it was a girl.
        “I’m Lex,” she said.
        
        I just looked at her, stood up, and walked straight to the bathroom.
        The teacher said, “This is the first time I’ve seen him like that, anyway.”

        I rushed to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. I washed my face and whispered, “Finally… I’ve got someone in person.”
I wanted to apologize, but I was too shy to even speak.

So, I headed back to class and listened to the lecture. The girl just looked at me.
That night, I had my laptop on in my room. I stared at the sky through the window beside me and said,
“That’s it. I’ll build her a website — as an apology and a way to make friends.”
So I worked on it all night.

My phone started buzzing.
My grandma shouted, “Get up now or you’ll be late!”
It was only five minutes before class started. I rushed out to school, and when I got there, I saw a guy — kind of feminine — touching the girl who had spoken to me the day before.
I don’t know why, but I suddenly felt like throwing my laptop at him. Or my bag.

Wait — my bag!
Oh no, I forgot it!

The teacher looked at me and said,
“Where have you been? Did you lock yourself in the bathroom again?”
She thought I had just come back from there.

I sat near the window again.
She whispered to me, “After school, I can lend you my notes.”
I looked at her and said, “Sure. I want to show you something too.”

After school, we went to the playground nearby and started talking.
At first, I was nervous to show her the website. I wanted to just say sorry, but instead, I showed it to her.
She was surprised.

“Wow, that’s cool! But it’s okay, I know you’re just shy. Haha. Let’s be friends!”

I smiled. “Let’s be friends.”

She handed me her notes, and since the playground was next to a church, we went there. We laughed, prayed, and listened quietly.

Before going home, we sat and rested for a while. We were getting closer...
But suddenly, someone called her. She started crying and hurried off.
She didn’t even say goodbye.
I didn’t chase her or ask what happened — she looked like she was in a rush.

The next morning, in class, she wasn’t there.
I asked the teacher where she was and what was wrong.
The teacher said, “I can’t share private information.”

So I started investigating on my own.

I went to the library and started reading — there was a detective novel that gave me some ideas. I ended up spending the whole day in the library instead of attending class.
After that, I bought everything I thought I’d need, and even though I’m an introvert, I began questioning people who might know something.

Finally, her cousin told me:
“It’s her dad. Someone stabbed him. He’s in the hospital now.”

I asked for the hospital details and rushed there.

When I saw her, I hugged her and said,
“You made me worry…”

    <section id="chapter2">
      <h2>Chapter 2 ⮟</h2>
      <p>
      She cried and said,
“My dad got stabbed… I don’t know why. My dad is kind. I don’t even know anyone who’s ever been angry with him. Maybe it was just some random guy… someone mentally ill.”

I replied,
“Sometimes, motivation doesn’t come from anger. It can come from jealousy… or opportunity.”

She looked stunned.
“Wow… you sound like a detective.”

I chuckled. “Yeah, I spent a whole day in the library reading that detective novel — just to figure out how to find you.”

She looked at me with wide eyes, then hugged me tightly.

“Why?” I asked.

She whispered,
“Don’t ask… just don’t. Wait for the doctor… outside.”

Suddenly, our hearts started beating faster — not because of each other, but because of what we feared the doctor might say.
We didn’t want to hear it… because what if he didn’t make it?

Everything became quiet. All we could hear was our own heartbeats.

Then the doctor finally said,
“Your dad is okay… but he still needs to stay in the hospital for a while, until he fully recovers.”

She suddenly hugged me again — even tighter.
I hesitated at first… but the strength in her hug felt like there was nothing more that needed to be said. So I hugged her back.

We went inside. Her father was asleep.

She cried again, gently holding his hand.
“Be strong, Dad… You’re the only one I have now, after Mom left us…”

Then, we saw it — a single tear fell from her father’s closed eyes.
That night, I lay in bed with the lights off. It was 10 p.m., and I just stared at the ceiling, thinking.
Who could be the suspect? Should I investigate?
...Nah, I’m probably just full of myself.
But… she did compliment me.

Still, what if the suspect tries to go after her dad again?
Or worse — her?

That thought shook me.
No… that can’t happen.

So, I got up and started studying how to be a real detective. I even started building a website to help me organize the investigation.
I spent the whole night working again.

The next day at school, she still wasn’t there.

I went straight to the library to read that detective novel again.
While I was there, my phone buzzed — my online friend messaged me.

Online Friend:
Wow, it’s been days since we last talked. I know you’re a quiet guy, but… are you okay?

I replied:

Yeah, I just made my first friend in person.

She messaged back quickly:

Wow… so you’re disposing of me now?

I laughed a little and typed:

That’s a harsh way to put it. I’m studying now — trying to become a detective.

She responded with a “haha” and wrote:

What for? You can’t even talk to people or go outside because of the crowd.

I said:

I know. But this… this is for my friend.

Online Friend:
Wow, you start valuing people faster than I thought.

Me:
Yeah… she is important.

Online Friend:
She?
Ohhh, so it’s a girl. Hahaha.
Okay, that explains why you’re acting this way.

Me:
What do you mean? Isn’t this normal between friends?

She just laughed again through text and wrote:

Soon… you’ll know.
        She texted me:

Bye, I just remembered something I forgot.

I replied:

Since when do you forget things? Aren’t you supposed to be a genius?

She didn’t respond right away, so I just typed:

Okay.

As I put my phone away, I noticed a guy nearby getting bullied.

Without thinking, I stood up and called out,
“What do you think you're doing?”

The bullies turned to me with annoyed faces.
“Aren’t you that invisible guy? You must have a death wish, stepping up to us.”

Then suddenly, I felt a tap on my shoulder.

I turned around — there was a guy standing behind me, smiling calmly.
“Well done,” he said with a grin, watching the bullies.

He let out a short laugh.

The bullies narrowed their eyes.
“And who the hell are you supposed to be?”

I glanced at him — he had a strong build, tall and confident, like someone who could actually win a fight.

He smiled wider and said,
“Me? I’m just here to clean up some trash. Yeah… I’m a cleaner.”

The bullies didn’t take him seriously and stepped forward.

In a split second, he kicked the first one in the face.
Then turned and punched the second guy, dropping him fast.

The third one tried to run.

The "cleaner" bent down, grabbed a fallen apple from the ground, and threw it with perfect aim.

Whack.

It hit the runner square in the back of the head. He stumbled and disappeared.

That day, I knew — this guy was going to be a big help to me.
